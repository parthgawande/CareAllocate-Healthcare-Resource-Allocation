# Healthcare Resource Allocation
## Big Data Technologies Project

The primary goal of the application is to provide a comprehensive, data-driven view of the Australian healthcare ecosystem, revealing trends and variations in resource utilisation across hospitals and regions.

The repository is organized into several key directories and files:

- **`data/`**: This folder contains all the relevant datasets in Excel format, along with an `images/` subdirectory for logos and other visual assets.

- **`dockerfiles/`**: Contains multiple Dockerfiles to support the various environments required by the project.

- **`media/`**: Includes media assets such as logos, workflow diagrams, and animated GIFs demonstrating the dashboard features.

- **`src/`**: The core source code is located here. It is divided into:
  - **`app/`**: Contains the dashboard application script and its dependencies.
  - **`processing/`**: ETL scripts, utility functions, and supporting libraries, including JAR files for data processing.

- **Root Files**: 
  - `LICENSE`: The licensing information for the project.
  - `README.md`: The main documentation file.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration file for Docker Compose to orchestrate the containerized environment.
  - `run.sh`: A shell script to execute the project setup.

## 2. Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SoniaBorsi/Healthcare-Resource-Allocation.git
   cd Healthcare-Resource-Allocation
2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   bash run.sh
3. **Wait for the the data to be loaded into the db**
   This usually takes about 1 hour, depending on your internet connection
4. **Access the dashboard**
   Got to localhost:8080 and explore all the analytics

Note: It is recommended that the dashboard is run once the data storing process is complete, in line with the current project status. This will be improved in a future update.


## 3. Workflow
The development of the Australian Efficient Resource Allocation App has been supported by a carefully selected suite of big data technologies, each chosen for its ability to address specific aspects of the system's architecture.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/SoniaBorsi/Healthcare-Resource-Allocation/blob/37bea7b0cef33684c724d18915b2af0d80de200c/media/BDT%20Diagram.png?raw=true" width="600"/>  
</p>

These technologies work seamlessly together to create a robust, scalable application capable of efficiently processing large volumes of health data. 

## 4. Data Sources

Healthcare data utilized in this project is primarily extracted from the [Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) API](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/myhospitals/content/api), an open and freely accessible resource. The available data includes:

- **Hospital Data**
- **Multi-Level Data**
- **Geographic Data**

In addition, this project integrates healthcare data with supplementary datasets provided by the [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au) to enrich the analysis and ensure comprehensive insights.
